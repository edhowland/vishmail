# vishmail
A mail client written Vish


## Abstract

This project is an email client written in  the Vish language  with Ruby
bindings.  It assumes you have some Maildir folders somewhere and you
have installed the MBlaze mail handler CLI package. The user interface
assumes familiarity with Vim navigation commands.

## Features

-  Mimics the Mutt key bindings
- Optimized for screen reader users like Voice Over on the Mac


## Meta Goals of this project

- A larger project than a toy project written in the the Vish language.
- Preamble to recrating Viper using this version of Vish.


So, this project should test the suitability of Vish in a larger context.
It should partition the UI elements into Vish using a functional style
of programming and the low-level stuff in Ruby itself via the Vish FFI
interface.
