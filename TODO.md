# Todo list for VishMail
## Todo: Move vish_base back into vish/lib/runtime/builtins.rb


Rebuild vishbase.rb


## Todo: Figure a way to recreate vishbase.rb from base.erb

It is a checken and egg problem. vishbase.rb is used to compute the location
of the /path/to/vish/bin/vishc file to load 
and get the compile + render methods from there.
